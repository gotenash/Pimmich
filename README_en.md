## üöÄ Installation

There are two methods to install Pimmich.

### Method 1: Pre-configured Image (Recommended and easier)

This method is ideal for a quick first-time installation.

1.  **Download the current month's image**
    Go to the Pimmich Releases page and download the `.img` file of the latest version.

2.  **Flash the image to an SD card**
    Use software like Raspberry Pi Imager or BalenaEtcher to write the image file you just downloaded to your microSD card.

3.  **Start your Raspberry Pi**
    Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect the screen and power supply. Pimmich will start automatically.

### Method 2: Manual Installation from Git Repository

This method is for advanced users or those who want to follow development closely.

#### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi (model 3B+, 4, or 5 recommended) with Raspberry Pi OS Desktop (64-bit).
- An SD card, a power supply, a screen.
- An Internet connection.

#### üìù Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**
    Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gotenash/pimmich.git
    cd pimmich
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script**
    This script installs all dependencies, configures the environment, and prepares for automatic startup.
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

This script installs system and Python dependencies, sets up the environment, and configures auto-start of the slideshow.

### üîë Get Your Immich API Token

1. Log into your Immich web interface  
2. Go to **Account Settings**

Click your profile icon (top-right), then choose **Account Settings**.

3. Generate a new API key  
In the **API Key** section, click **Generate new API Key** and give it a name (e.g., `PimmichFrame`).

‚ö†Ô∏è Once the token is shown, **copy it immediately** ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be able to see it again. If lost, you‚Äôll need to generate a new one.

üîí We recommend creating a dedicated Immich account for the photo frame, with access to a single shared album.

### Connect to Pimmich

From a web browser on another device, access:

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Interface

### Slideshow Settings

Here, you can set the display time per photo (minimum ~10s, due to background blur processing for portrait images) and define active hours for the slideshow.

### Photo Import Settings

Choose between importing from an Immich album or a USB stick, and manage downloaded files.
